# HelpDesk Node.js Application

## Project Overview

**HelpDesk** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline IT support and service request management within organizations. It enables users to report technical issues, track ticket statuses, and access a self-service knowledge base ‚Äî all in one centralized platform.

Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **EJS**, the system supports:
- Role-based access control
- Ticket lifecycle and queue management
- Internal messaging between staff and users
- Knowledge base article creation
- Administrative reporting

The project was developed by a team of 4 members. I contributed in multiple key roles throughout the software development lifecycle ‚Äî including **System Analyst**, **System Designer**, **Full-stack Developer**, and **Quality Assurance**.

## System Analysis & Design

This project was developed based on a solid **System Analysis & Design** foundation to ensure clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability. The team followed standard **SDLC practices**, including comprehensive modeling to guide implementation and testing.

Detailed system design document is available here: [System Design Document](./docs/system-analysis/System_Design.pdf)

### üë®‚Äçüíª My Roles
- **System Analyst**
- **System Designer**
- **Developer**
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**

### üîç Analysis Phase

- **Use Case Diagram**: Identified system actors (User, Staff, Admin) and their interactions.
- **Use Case Descriptions**: Defined step-by-step behavior for each use case.
- **Screen Prototypes**: Created wireframes to visualize key interfaces and user flows.
- **Object Identification**: Extracted real-world entities for modeling relationships.

### üß† Design Phase

- **Domain Class Diagram**: Modeled key entities like `Ticket`, `User`, `Queue`, `Article`.
- **Statechart Diagram (Ticket)**: Defined status transitions:  
  `NEW ‚Üí ASSIGNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí RESOLVED ‚Üí CLOSED`
- **Class Diagram with Attributes**: Specified class responsibilities, attributes, and associations.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Modeled interactions for:
  - Ticket Creation
  - Ticket Assignment
  - Staff‚ÄìUser Communication
- **ER Diagram**: Translated the domain model into a relational schema using Sequelize ORM.
- **Activity Diagram**: Visualized the end-to-end ticket processing workflow.

### ‚úÖ Example Use Case: Ticket Submission

- **Actor**: User  
- **Precondition**: User is authenticated  
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User submits ticket via web form
  2. System creates a ticket with status `NEW`
  3. Ticket is queued for processing
  4. User monitors status via dashboard  
- **Postcondition**: Ticket is successfully logged and ready for assignment

## Testing Strategy

To ensure a reliable and bug-free experience, we adopted a structured **Software Testing** approach ‚Äî including test planning, execution, and defect reporting. As part of my QA responsibilities, I led the testing process for major system components.

### üß™ Test Coverage

#### ‚úÖ Functional Testing
- **Authentication**: Login, registration, and role-based access
- **Ticket System**:
  - Ticket submission, status tracking
  - Queue assignment (auto/manual)
- **Knowledge Base**: Search, add, edit, delete articles
- **User Management**: Role-based access, CRUD operations
- **Internal Communication**: Comments and notifications between staff and users

#### üß∑ Non-Functional Testing
- Responsive UI across devices
- Robust error handling and validation
- System stability under concurrent usage

### üìã Test Artifacts

- **Test Case Documents**: Mapped directly from use cases
- **Manual Testing Reports**: Logged in spreadsheets and GitHub Issues
- **Bug Tracking**: Real-time collaboration on fixing and retesting
- **Regression Testing**: Run after every major update

### üõ† Tools Used

| Tool             | Purpose                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Postman**       | API testing                        |
| **JIRA / Trello** | Test case tracking and bug logging |
| **Excel / Sheets**| Manual test case documentation     |
| **Browser DevTools** | UI/Console/Network testing     |
| **Mochawesome** *(Optional)* | Future test automation readiness |
